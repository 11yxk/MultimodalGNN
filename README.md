# MultimodalGNN
Pytorch implementation of paper 'Integrating Text and Medical Images for Segmentation Using Interpretable Graph Neural Networks'
We will update the code progressively.

# Data Preparation
We borrow the data process from [LViT](https://github.com/HUANGLIZI/LViT).


### Training
```
python train.py
```

This repo is based on [TransUnet](https://github.com/Junelin2333/LanGuideMedSeg-MICCAI2023).
